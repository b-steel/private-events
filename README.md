# private-events

This project is from *The Odin Project's* Ruby on Rails course, but I've chosen to design it in Python/ Django.

[Link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) the the project page and description. 

In simple terms it's a basic level clone of [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) facilitating event coordination
