<!-- This is not going to be served on the page, it's just going to be a place for me to edit the page and then I'll use the markdown package to convert it over to html, that way I can edit thinigs easily here. -->

Welcome to *Private Events*, an events manager page where you can create events and invite friends.  

Feel free to look around, you can create your own account, or if you'd just like to explore some functionality you can log in with the username **test_user** (There's no password required)

The project was created with Django, using a bit of jQuery to deal with some of the button clicks, such as sending or accepting an invite.  

You can take a look at the [README](link) if you'd like a more in depth discussion of the steps I took to create the page.
